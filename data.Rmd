## Load Packages
Before reading and summarizing the data, some necessary packages must be loaded.

```{r}
# get information about businesses
api_info <- httr::GET("https://www.fueleconomy.gov/ws/rest/vehicle/menu/year") #this url has to follow resources manual on the website  
str(api_info, max.level = 1)

library(tidyverse)
api_char <- base::rawToChar(api_info$content)
api_JSON <- jsonlite::fromJSON(api_char, flatten=TRUE) 
parsed <- fromJSON(rawToChar(api_info$content))  #click on parsed and click on drop down for item that has data in (this one is named articles) and there you will see the names of the other variables but i think they all start with id and name
str(parsed)
article <- as_tibble(parsed$menuItem) #see articles is selected here and is now a dataframe

#removed source from first two columns id and name that had source$ attached to it
article <- article |> mutate(id=article$source$id,
name=article$source$name) |> select(id, name, everything(), -source)
article

```
